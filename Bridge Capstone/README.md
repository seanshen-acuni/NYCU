# Bridge Design Project (Civil Engineering Capstone)

## Description
This project documents the design and analysis of a **cable-stayed bridge** as part of Civil Engineering coursework at NYCU.  
It combines conceptual design, structural parameter modeling, and multi-hazard load analysis using **CSiBridge** and CAD tools, with results delivered through technical documentation, presentations, and physical/virtual models.

## Role
**Lead Structural-Parameter Designer (CSiBridge)** – Sean Shen (沈昱翔)

Responsibilities:
- Designed bridge geometry and structural parameters (pylon, deck, cables, and traffic lanes) to keep moments and vertical displacements within allowable limits  
- Modeled multi-hazard load combinations; conducted static analyses (dead, vehicle, wind) and dynamic analyses (seismic response-spectrum and time-history)  
- Developed 3D schematics with load response animations  
- Contributed to team deliverables including:
  - 51-page technical report  
  - Conference-style slide deck  
  - Physical and virtual models  

## Files
- `ReportInClass118.pdf` – Presentation slides (conference-style)  
- `CPreportII.pdf` – Full 51-page technical report  
- `Bridge_Cross-section-1.pdf`, `Front_View-2.pdf`, `Top_View-3.pdf` – Structural drawings  
- `SCB_MainDeck-9.dxf` – CAD drawing (AutoCAD DXF format)  
- `SeismicRS.txt`, `Artificial_1.txt` – Seismic response-spectrum and artificial earthquake input data  
- `zeta.bdb` – CSiBridge model file  

## Tools & Methods
- **CSiBridge** – structural modeling, load combinations, static and dynamic analyses  
- **AutoCAD / Rhino** – drawings and 3D visualization  
- **Physical scale model** – experimental representation of structural behavior  

## Requirements
- CSiBridge (for structural model and load analysis)  
- AutoCAD or Rhino (for geometry and DXF visualization)  
- Standard PDF viewer  

## Usage
These files serve as documentation and analysis references.  
To explore:
1. Open `ReportInClass118.pdf` for a project overview.  
2. Review `CPreportII.pdf` for the detailed technical report.  
3. Open `*.pdf` drawings and `*.dxf` file for bridge schematics.  
4. Load `SeismicRS.txt`, `Artificial_1.txt`, and `zeta.bdb` in CSiBridge for analysis reproduction.
